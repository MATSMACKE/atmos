# atmos
## A very simple CLI for doing standard atmosphere calculations

### Usage

For the C version, simply run `./atmos h`, putting your altitude in meters instead of `h`. For example, for 10 km altitude: `./atmos 10000`.

For the Haskell version, run ./atmos, and it'll be obvious from there.

### Compiling

For the C version, a C compiler and standard library are required.

For the Haskell version, GHC and the Haskell standard library are required.
